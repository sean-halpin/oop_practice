### SOLID Principles Analysis

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - **Used Well**: Each class has a single responsibility:
     - `ConsoleLogWriter` handles the actual writing of log messages to the console.
     - `JsonLogFormatter` formats log messages as JSON.
     - `Logger` manages the logging process, including deciding when to log messages and formatting them.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: The `Logger` class could potentially have more responsibilities if it starts handling more complex logging scenarios. However, in its current form, it adheres well to SRP.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - **Used Well**: The `Logger` class is open for extension but closed for modification. You can introduce new log formats and writers without modifying the `Logger` class. For example, adding a new log formatter or log writer would involve creating new classes implementing `ILogFormatter` or `ILogWriter` without changing the `Logger` class itself.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: The system could be improved by defining more abstract logging configurations or strategies to support more complex scenarios. For instance, introducing a configuration mechanism or a dependency injection framework could further enhance extensibility.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - **Used Well**: `ConsoleLogWriter` and `JsonLogFormatter` both implement their respective interfaces correctly. Any instance of `ILogWriter` or `ILogFormatter` can be used in place of the expected type, adhering to LSP.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: No immediate violations of LSP are present in this code. Each subclass or implementation can replace the base class or interface without altering the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - **Used Well**: The interfaces `ILogFormatter` and `ILogWriter` are well-segregated and contain only the methods needed by their implementers. There are no large, unwieldy interfaces.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: No specific improvements are needed for ISP as the interfaces are already well-defined.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - **Used Well**: `Logger` depends on abstractions (`ILogFormatter` and `ILogWriter`) rather than concrete implementations. This promotes flexibility and makes the `Logger` class less tightly coupled to specific implementations.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: A dependency injection framework or service locator pattern could enhance dependency management and allow for more flexible configuration of `Logger`.

### CLEAN Code Principles Analysis

1. **Meaningful Names**:
   - **Used Well**: The names of the classes, methods, and variables are descriptive and convey their purpose effectively. For example, `ConsoleLogWriter`, `JsonLogFormatter`, and `Logger` clearly describe their roles.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: No major issues here. Names are appropriate for their purposes.

2. **Functions Should Do One Thing**:
   - **Used Well**: Methods like `Format` in `JsonLogFormatter` and `Write` in `ConsoleLogWriter` perform a single, well-defined task. The `Log` method in `Logger` also adheres to this principle by delegating tasks to the appropriate formatter and writer.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: `Logger.Log` method does handle multiple responsibilities (checking log level, formatting, and writing). This is acceptable but could be further refined by separating these concerns into different methods or classes.

3. **Avoiding Duplication**:
   - **Used Well**: There is no noticeable duplication of code. Each class has a unique responsibility, and functionality is reused via composition.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: The current implementation avoids duplication well, but as more features or logging formats are added, attention should be given to avoid duplication in the format and write implementations.

4. **Commenting and Readability**:
   - **Used Well**: The code is mostly self-explanatory with clear and concise names. There are no unnecessary comments, and the code's purpose is clear from the structure and naming conventions.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: While the code is readable, some inline comments explaining the purpose of key components or the rationale behind certain design choices could be beneficial for maintainability.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - **Missing**: The current implementation does not include error handling. For example, if `JsonSerializer.Serialize` fails or if there's an issue with the `Console.WriteLine` method, these scenarios are not handled.
   - **Improvements**: Implementing error handling or logging errors during formatting and writing could make the system more robust.

6. **Testing and Testability**:
   - **Used Well**: The code is designed in a way that makes it easy to test individual components (`ILogWriter`, `ILogFormatter`, and `Logger`) in isolation.
   - **Missing/Improvements**: Adding unit tests for each component and integration tests to verify the interaction between `Logger`, `ILogFormatter`, and `ILogWriter` would ensure that the code performs as expected and is resilient to changes.

### Summary

The implementation adheres well to SOLID and CLEAN principles. The major areas for improvement involve adding error handling and enhancing the testability of the code. These changes would contribute to making the system more robust and maintainable.
